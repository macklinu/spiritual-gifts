      Respond to each question on the Spiritual Gifts Assessment (found on the
      next few pages) according to the following scale:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Not at All / Never True</li>
      <li>Sometimes / True Once in a While</li>
      <li>Most of the Time / Usually True</li>
      <li>Consistently / Definitely True</li>
    </ol>

        think you ought to be.

      Don’t labor over each question. Just read it and answer it. Click the
      first answer that pops into your mind.
    </p>

      <i>Pray</i> before and during the process of taking the assessment. Let
      God speak to you about this. After all, they’re His gifts.
